                    <p>I am an engineer working in a team of hard-boiled QEs. 
                        Our client is a product-based company in the insurance domain. 
                        We are building a complex travel insurance website that will soon be replacing their current one. 
                        Our bread and butter's identifying and reporting bugs. Bugs range from overlooked unit test scenarios to complete misinterpretations of BU inputs. 
                        When we are not bug hunting, we usually spend our time designing new test scenarios and coordinating with devs and BUs. 
                        The QEs are also responsible for designing and maintaining automation scripts. 
                        So you can say we are a busy bunch.</p>
